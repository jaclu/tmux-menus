#
#   Main menu, the one popping up when you hit the trigger
#
#   Types of menu item lines.
#
#   1) An item leading to an action
#          "Description" "In-menu key" "Action taken when it is triggered"
#
#   2) Just a line of text
#      You must supply two empty strings, in order for the
#      menu logic to interpret it as a full menu line item.
#          "Some text to display" "" ""
#
#   3) Separator line
#      This is a proper graphical separator line, without any label.
#          ""
#
#   4) Labeled separator line
#      Not perfect, since you will have at least one space on each side of
#      the labeled separator line, but using something like this and carefully
#      increase the dashes until you are just below forcing the menu to just
#      grow wider, seems to be as close as it gets.
#          "#[align=centre]-----  Other stuff  -----" "" ""
#
#
#   All but the last line in the menu, needs to end with a continuation \
#   White space after this \ will cause the menu to fail!
#   For any field containing no spaces, quotes are optional.
