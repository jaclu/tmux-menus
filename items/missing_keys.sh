#  Sending keys that might not always be accessible, depending on
#  keyboards or their mappings.
#
#  Especially when using tablets with keyboards, the number row might
#  be mapped to function keys, thus blocking several keys.
#  For some, me included. It is often quicker to use a menu to generate
#  missing keys, vs fiddling with cut and paste from some other source
#  for such keys.
