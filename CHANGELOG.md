  sockets will always be used to minimize risk for collisions if an inner tmux uses
  this plugin in stdalone tools, like `external_dialog*\*`
- scripts/utils/std*alone_log.sh - Tries to pick up current log_file if defined
  otherwise logs to /dev/stderr, used by external tools that don't load the entire
  environment like `external_dialog*\*`
