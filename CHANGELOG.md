## [2.2.4] - 2025-05-09

### Added

- time_span(org_time) - sets t_time_span to time since org_time
- copied definition of TMUX*BIN to scripts/utils/define_tmux_bin.sh in order to ensure
  sockets will always be used to minimize risk for collisions if an inner tmux uses
  this plugin in stdalone tools, like `external_dialog*\*`
- scripts/utils/std*alone_log.sh - Tries to pick up current log_file if defined
  otherwise logs to /dev/stderr, used by external tools that don't load the entire
  environment like `external_dialog*\*`

### Changed

- Bug fix: fix_home_path() - Now correctly handles the odd behaviour of tmux 3.4
- Bug fix: forgetting to check if cache is active in dialog_handling.sh:handle_dynamic()
- Bug fix: verify_menu_runable() - escape ' in order to display errors in menu code
- Bug fix: scripts/update_custom_inventory.sh - ensure main menu is cleared if
  custom items are removed, to ensure main menu stops offering custom menus

- menu_parse() - optimized processing
- menu_generate_part() - abort early for empty parts
- tmux_error_handler_assign() - streamlined for performance and added inline comments
- get_menu_items_sorted() & cache_read_menu_items() - simplified code, slight performance boost
- Added run_if_found() - makes code cleaner
- Improved error detection when parsing and displaying menus
- 'Move pane' & 'Move Window' - Corrected check when pane is marked in another context
