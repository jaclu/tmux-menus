#  tmux env is read each time this plugin init script is run, so changes
#  in tmux version or your tmux conf file will be detected and trigger
#  a cache replacement.
#
#  tpm will call this during a tmux source-file call, so this cache can
#  be trusted by the menu items to contain current tmux env variables.
#
#  One thing to be aware of - If multiple tmux instances of the same version
#  use the same folder for this plugin, this cache approach might not work
#  as intended, since the tmux env is just read once then this cache is used.
#
#  If those tmux instances do not have identical tmux-menus configuration,
#  thing will not work as intended.
#
#  Therefore each instance using tmux-menus should use a separate folder
#  for the plugin, not using soft-links to the same folder!
