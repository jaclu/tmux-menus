# Plan

## New feature: Show cmds

By pressing `!` for each command in current menu list current binding (if any).
Otherwise show the tmux sequence needed for the command including any support
scripts, but excluding menu reload.

## Currencies - Zloty

The symbol is two chars, so work around the current one char limitation

## WhipTail

- menu_reload is not working, so disabled

## external_tools/dropbox.sh

toggle not working

## Pane titles

Add items, enable/disable show pane titles

## Show defaults

See if instead of just displaying defaults as (x) , displaying current
binding as [x] is possible

Seems hard to implement, left as a long term goal
