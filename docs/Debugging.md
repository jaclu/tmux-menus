# Debugging

If a log_file is defined (@menus_log_file), it will be used for status updates
generated by `log_it "msg"`

If `log_interactive_to_stderr` is set to 1, logging will be done to /dev/stderr
for interactive scripts (run from the command line), this is set in
`scripts/helpers_minimal.sh` around line 365. This is independent
of the log_file logging decision

Some environment variables that can be used

by putting the line `teh_debug=true` before a call to `tmux_error_handler` that
call will be logged in great detail in order to trace syntax issues before resetting
teh_debug to false.
It will also limit the error_display in case of errors to a one-liner in the log_file
In order not to flood the log with an elaborate error report.

## TMUX_MENUS_SHOW_CMDS

If this is defined `Display commands` will be available, regardless of what
`@menus_display_commands` is set to.

Be aware, if this feature is used, it is in most cases recommended to set
it to `0` this will make `Display commands` available but not enabled by default.

- `0` - `Display commands` forced to be available, menus defaults to not show commands
- `1` - `Display commands` forced to be available, menus defaults to show commands
- Any other value will be treated as a `0`

## TMUX_MENUS_LOGGING_MINIMAL

Convenient if a lot of debugging is enabled to temporarily minimize/disable it

- `1` - only calls to log_it_minimal() will be displayed, by default that is errors
  and menu rendering times
- `2` - no logging at all

## TMUX_MENUS_HANDLER

- `0` - (default) use built in menus if available, otherwise whiptail/dialog if found
- `1` - force whiptail
- `2` - force dialog

## TMUX_MENUS_PROFILING

If set to 1 profiling will be used and `profiling_display "some message"`
will print total time and time since last profiling_display

For more details check `scripts/utils/dbg_profiling.sh`

If not set to 1 `profiling_display` statements will be ignored

might be practical to also use`export TMUX_MENUS_LOGGING_MINIMAL=1`
for isolation of profiling output

## TMUX_MENUS_NO_DISPLAY

If set to `1` menu will be processed, but not actually displayed, it will also
prevent the cfg_trigger_key from being bound.
